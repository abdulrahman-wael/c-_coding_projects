# c_plusplus_coding_projects
This repository contains 6 C++ projects I made as part of [Dr. Mostafa Saad's courses on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/mostafasaadibrahim/?srsltid=AfmBOopw8UQMubGLseN1a0z8ZAsENWNGxLL28OAjgZ8lwXhUne5uC4JY). Each project focuses on different real-world systems and data structures, providing hands-on experience with C++.

Skills:
c++ basics (all), data structures (6), UML class diagrams (4), file handling (3,4,5), OOP (2,3,4,5), and others

Projects:
1. 🏥 Hospital System - A system for managing hospital records, patients, and staff.
2. 📚 Library System - A library management system to handle books, users, borrowing, and returning.
3. 💬 Ask.fm System - A Q&A simulation similar to Ask.fm, allowing users to ask and answer questions.
4. 📖 Book Store System - A store management system for handling inventory, sales, and customer data.
5. ✈️ Expedia Simulation System - A travel booking simulation, handling flights, hotels, and reservations.
6. 🧮 Sparse Matrix (Data Structure) - A project focused on implementing and manipulating sparse matrices.

I developed the code for these projects independently as part of my training. After reviewing the solutions provided by my instructor, I made modifications to enhance the code.
