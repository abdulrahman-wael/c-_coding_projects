# Hospital Queue Management System

## Overview
This project implements a hospital queue management system that allows for managing patients based on their specialization and urgency status. 
The system supports adding patients to the queue, printing all patients in the queue, and retrieving the next patient based on their urgency status.

## Features
- **Manage Multiple Specializations**: The system can handle up to 20 different specializations.
- **Add Patients**: Patients can be added either to the front (urgent) or the end (normal) of the queue based on their urgency status.
- **Print Patient Lists**: Displays all patients in a specified specialization, including their urgency status.
- **Retrieve Next Patient**: Allows retrieval of the next patient in line for consultation.

## Learning outcomes
1. Data Structures: Understand and manipulate custom data structures (queues) in C++ 📊.
2. C++ Skills: Improve proficiency in C++ with classes and functions 💻.
3. Algorithmic Thinking: Develop algorithms for queue operations (add, remove, print) 🔍.
4. User Interface Design: Create a command-line interface for user interaction 🎛️.
5. Problem Solving: Handle real-world patient management scenarios 🏥.
