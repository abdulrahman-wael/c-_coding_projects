# Overview

This project is a command-line application in C++ that simulates a user and book management system. 
Users can sign up, log in, view book details, and manage their reading history. The project demonstrates basic file handling, user authentication, and data management in C++.

## Features

- **User Management**: Users can create accounts, log in, and have their details stored in a `users.txt` file for persistence.
- **Book Management**: Users can view available books, which are stored in a `books.txt` file.
- **Reading History Tracking**: Users can maintain a reading history, which is stored in a `reading_history.txt` file.
- **UML Class Design**: The system is designed based on a UML class diagram created before the project's implementation.
  it has been revised after completing the project to reflect the final structure and relationships.

## Key Learning Outcomes 🎓

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Gain hands-on experience with OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 📦
- **File Handling**: Learn how to read from and write to text files in C++, enabling persistent data storage for user accounts and reading history. 📄
- **User Authentication**: Implement a simple user login system, enhancing understanding of basic security concepts in software development. 🔐
- **Data Management**: Develop skills in managing and organizing data effectively, improving your ability to handle real-world applications. 📊
- **UML Design**: Apply UML class diagrams in both the planning and execution phases, reinforcing the importance of design in software development. 🛠️
